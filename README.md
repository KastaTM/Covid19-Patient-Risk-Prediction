# COVID-19 Patient Risk Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict the severity of illness in COVID-19 patients. By analyzing patient demographics, clinical symptoms, and laboratory test results, we aim to identify individuals at high risk of severe illness, enabling early interventions and optimized healthcare resource allocation.

## 🎯 Objectives
- **Business Goal**: Assist healthcare professionals in identifying high-risk COVID-19 patients to improve patient outcomes and optimize hospital resources.
- **Data Mining Goal**: Develop a predictive model that estimates the likelihood of severe illness using clinical and demographic data.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset consists of synthetic patient records from two hospitals, including:
- **Demographics**: Age, sex, nationality.
- **Clinical Measurements**: Body temperature, oxygen saturation.
- **Symptoms and Comorbidities**: Reported conditions at hospital admission.
- **PCR Test Results**: Indicating COVID-19 infection status.

## 📈 Methodology
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding feature distributions, missing values, and correlations.
2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handling missing data
   - Feature encoding and transformation
   - Data normalization
3. **Model Development**:
   - Training machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Deep Learning)
   - Hyperparameter tuning
   - Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC.
4. **Model Interpretation & Insights**:
   - Identifying key predictors of severe illness.
   - Evaluating fairness and bias in predictions.
5. **Deployment Considerations**:
   - Integration into hospital decision-making systems.
   - Ethical and privacy considerations.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python 🐍
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For analysis and model training
- **Visualization**: Plotly, Matplotlib for data insights
